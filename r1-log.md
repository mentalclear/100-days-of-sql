Day 01 of #100DaysOfSQL

### R1D2
Day 02 of #100DaysOfSQL

### R1D3
Day 03 of #100DaysOfSQL 
Went over a SQL exercise from here: https://pgexercises.com/questions/joins/
Wasn't very happy with my result. Started refreshing SQL queries using the book:
Learning SQL, 3rd Edition. Found a port of sakila DB, will try to install it in 
my local PostgreSQL instance.  

### R1D4
Day 04 of #100DaysOfSQL 
Worked through Capter 2 from a book Learning SQL, 3rd Edition. Making my life complicated by adapting MySQL related learning material to my local PostgreSQL :) But it seams more fun like that!

### R1D5
Day 05 of #100DaysOfSQL 
Worked through Capter 3 from a book Learning SQL, 3rd Edition from O'Reilly. Again had to adapt MySQL related learning material to PostgreSQL. Not that bad TBH. Spent a lot of time on that. 
But it goes! Will do exercises tomorrow. 

### R1D6
