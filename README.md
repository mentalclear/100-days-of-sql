# 100DaysOfSQL Challenge 

## Rationale: 
As a Software Engineer and Tester, I want to keep my SQL skills sharp. 
   
_The Why?_  
I understand all the basics and a quick refresh will be enough for me to write a query
that I need. But...  
Often times it's not enough, especially in _job interviews_ where 
interviewers are suspicious regarding the candidate's SQL abilities.

_The Plan_  
So this challenge is to commit to using SQL on a daily basis to have the SQL skills sharp.  
And... who knows where it might take? :man_shrugging:
