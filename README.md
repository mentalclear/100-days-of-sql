# 100DaysOfSQL Challenge 

### Rationale: 
As a QA Engineer I do little SQL in my daily work and that makes 
SQL a second class citizen in my skillset. I undersatand all the 
basics and a quick refresh will be enough for me to write a query
that I need. 
But... 
Often times it's not enough, especially in job interviews where 
people often suspicius regarding candidate's SQL abilities. 

So this challenge is to commit to using SQL on a daily basis to 
have the SQL skills sharp. And... who knows where it might take? :man_shrugging:
